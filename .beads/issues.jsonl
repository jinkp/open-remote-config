{"id":"plugin-n9k","title":"Add remote agent registration via config hook","description":"## Overview\n\nExtend the `opencode-remote-skills` plugin to discover and register **agents** from remote Git repositories via the OpenCode `config` hook, without requiring changes to the user's OpenCode config directory.\n\n## Background\n\nOpenCode has two distinct concepts:\n- **Skills**: Reference documents loaded via the `skill` tool (require symlinks)\n- **Agents**: Autonomous subagents delegated to via the `task` tool (can be injected via config hook)\n\nThe existing plugin handles skills via symlinks. This epic adds agent support via the `config` hook, which allows plugins to mutate the config object before agents are loaded.\n\n## Repository Structure Convention\n\nRemote repositories follow OpenCode's native directory structure:\n\n```\nmy-repo/\n├── skill/                      # Existing - skills (SKILL.md files)\n│   └── code-review/\n│       └── SKILL.md\n└── agent/                      # NEW - agents (*.md files)\n    ├── code-reviewer.md        # Agent: \"code-reviewer\"\n    ├── kotlin-pro.md           # Agent: \"kotlin-pro\"\n    └── specialized/            # Nested agents\n        └── db-expert.md        # Agent: \"specialized/db-expert\"\n```\n\n## Agent Markdown Format\n\nAgents use the same format as OpenCode native agents:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Expert code review specialist\nmode: subagent\nmodel: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514\ncolor: \"#FF5733\"\ntemperature: 0.3\npermission:\n  edit: deny\n  bash: ask\nsteps: 50\n---\n\nYou are an expert code reviewer...\n```\n\nThis translates to `AgentConfig` JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code-reviewer\": {\n    \"description\": \"Expert code review specialist\",\n    \"mode\": \"subagent\",\n    \"model\": \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n    \"color\": \"#FF5733\",\n    \"temperature\": 0.3,\n    \"permission\": {\n      \"edit\": \"deny\",\n      \"bash\": \"ask\"\n    },\n    \"steps\": 50,\n    \"prompt\": \"You are an expert code reviewer...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nExtend `remote-skills.json` to support optional agent filtering:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"git@github.com:company/shared-config.git\",\n      \"ref\": \"main\",\n      \"skills\": [\"code-review\", \"git-commit\"],\n      \"agents\": [\"code-reviewer\", \"kotlin-pro\"]  // NEW - optional filter\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"git@github.com:team/team-tools.git\",\n      \"skills\": \"*\",\n      \"agents\": \"*\"  // Import all agents\n    }\n  ],\n  \"sync\": \"blocking\"\n}\n```\n\n## Priority Order (Conflict Resolution)\n\n1. **User's local config** (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `.opencode/agent/*.md`) - highest priority\n2. **First remote repository** that defines an agent - wins\n3. **Subsequent repositories** with same agent name - logged and skipped\n\n## Error Handling\n\nMatch skills behavior - graceful degradation with logging:\n1. **Parsing fails** (invalid YAML): Log warning, skip the agent\n2. **Validation fails** (invalid schema): Log warning with details, skip the agent\n3. **File without frontmatter**: Silently skip (not an agent definition)\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### New Dependency: `gray-matter`\n\nAdd the `gray-matter` npm package for parsing markdown frontmatter. This is the same library OpenCode uses internally.\n\n### New File: `src/agent.ts`\n\nDefine Zod schemas matching OpenCode's `AgentConfig`:\n\n```typescript\nconst PermissionAction = z.enum([\"ask\", \"allow\", \"deny\"])\nconst PermissionRule = z.union([PermissionAction, z.record(z.string(), PermissionAction)])\nconst Permission = z.record(z.string(), PermissionRule).or(PermissionAction)\n\nexport const AgentConfigSchema = z.object({\n  model: z.string().optional(),\n  temperature: z.number().optional(),\n  top_p: z.number().optional(),\n  prompt: z.string().optional(),\n  tools: z.record(z.string(), z.boolean()).optional(),\n  disable: z.boolean().optional(),\n  description: z.string().optional(),\n  mode: z.enum([\"subagent\", \"primary\", \"all\"]).optional(),\n  options: z.record(z.string(), z.any()).optional(),\n  color: z.string().regex(/^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$/).optional(),\n  steps: z.number().int().positive().optional(),\n  maxSteps: z.number().int().positive().optional(),\n  permission: Permission.optional(),\n}).passthrough()\n\nexport interface AgentInfo {\n  name: string\n  path: string\n  config: AgentConfig\n}\n```\n\n### Modified File: `src/config.ts`\n\nAdd `agents` filter to `RepositoryConfigSchema`:\n\n```typescript\nexport const RepositoryConfigSchema = z.object({\n  url: z.string().min(1),\n  ref: z.string().optional(),\n  skills: z.union([z.literal(\"*\"), z.array(z.string())]).optional(),\n  agents: z.union([z.literal(\"*\"), z.array(z.string())]).optional(),  // NEW\n}).strict()\n```\n\n### Modified File: `src/git.ts`\n\nAdd agent discovery:\n\n```typescript\nexport interface SyncResult {\n  // existing fields...\n  skills: SkillInfo[]\n  agents: AgentInfo[]   // NEW\n}\n\nexport async function discoverAgents(repoPath: string): Promise\u003cAgentInfo[]\u003e\n```\n\nAgent discovery logic:\n1. Look for `agent/` or `agents/` directory\n2. Recursively find all `*.md` files\n3. Parse with `gray-matter` (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)\n4. Skip files without frontmatter\n5. Validate against `AgentConfigSchema`\n6. Calculate name from path: `agent/category/name.md` → `category/name`\n7. Return array of `AgentInfo`\n\n### Modified File: `src/index.ts`\n\nAdd `config` hook:\n\n```typescript\nreturn {\n  config: async (config) =\u003e {\n    config.agent = config.agent || {}\n    \n    for (const [name, { config: agentConfig, source }] of remoteAgents) {\n      if (config.agent[name]) {\n        log(`⚠ Agent '${name}' exists in user config, skipping remote from ${source}`)\n        continue\n      }\n      config.agent[name] = agentConfig\n    }\n  },\n  // existing event handler...\n}\n```\n\n## Files Changed Summary\n\n| File              | Change Type | Description                                                    |\n| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `package.json`      | Modify      | Add `gray-matter` dependency, update description                 |\n| `src/agent.ts`      | New         | AgentConfig schema and AgentInfo type                          |\n| `src/config.ts`     | Modify      | Add `agents` filter to RepositoryConfig                          |\n| `src/git.ts`        | Modify      | Add `discoverAgents()`, update SyncResult, update sync functions |\n| `src/index.ts`      | Modify      | Add `config` hook to inject agents                               |\n| `src/agent.test.ts` | New         | Tests for agent parsing and validation                         |\n| `src/git.test.ts`   | Modify      | Add agent discovery tests                                      |\n| `README.md`         | Modify      | Document agent support                                         |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Agents discovered from `agent/` or `agents/` directories in remote repos\n- [ ] Nested agent naming works: `agent/category/name.md` → `category/name`\n- [ ] YAML frontmatter parsed correctly with `gray-matter`\n- [ ] Agent config validated against Zod schema\n- [ ] Invalid agents logged and skipped (graceful degradation)\n- [ ] User config takes priority over remote agents\n- [ ] First plugin registration wins for duplicate agent names\n- [ ] Duplicate/conflict cases logged appropriately\n- [ ] Optional `agents` filter in repository config works\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] README updated with agent documentation","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-04T09:53:58.273116+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-04T10:35:31.858174+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-04T10:35:31.858174+01:00","close_reason":"Remote agent registration fully implemented with discovery, config hook injection, priority handling, and comprehensive tests"}
